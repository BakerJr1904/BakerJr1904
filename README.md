The  online data Science courses I have been taking are focused on technical and professional skills hiring managers need most. I attend live, online lectures led by experienced data scientists who have trained me on industry-current tools and techniques for the data science field, including best practices in the Python ecosystem.  I've also learned to analyze a variety of types of data, built reproducible data analytics and data-powered systems, and understand how to communicate and build on my insights. I've gained fundamental computer science skills. Plus I am doing an internship with Underdog-Devs.org, as the lead Machine Learning

- Data Wrangling and Storytelling<br>
- Statistical Analysis<br>
- Test Experiments<br>
- Linear Algebra<br>
- Linear Models<br>
- Model Comparison<br>
- Applied Modeling<br>
- Data Visualization<br>
- Software Engineering<br>
- SQL, noSQL, and Databases<br>
- Productization<br>
- Cloud Implementation<br>
- Natural Language Processing<br>
- Neural Network Foundations<br>
- Cutting-edge models<br>
- Architectures<br>
- Intro to Python and OOP<br>
- Algorithms<br>
- Data Structures and Graphs<br>
- Hash Tables<br><br>

“Nothing in the world can take the place of persistence. 
Talent will not; nothing is more common than unsuccessful people with talent. 
Genius will not; unrewarded genius is almost a proverb. 
Education will not; the world is full of educated derelicts. 
Persistence and determination alone are omnipotent. 
The slogan Press On! has solved and always will solve the problems of the human race.”
